/*
Circle Area
3/14/2021
The program should store the value 3.14159 in a constant called PI, the value
4 in a variable called radius, and then calculates the area of a circle with
the given radius. Currently, the program has several incomplete or missing
lines, which are marked with comments. Using the comments as a guide, add the
code to complete the program.

    // declare a constant called PI with the value 3.14159
    // declare a variable called radius with the value 4
    double area = PI * pow(radius, 2);
    cout << "Area of the circle: " << area;
